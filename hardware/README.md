LED driver hardware
===================

The ATmega328P can fade 32 LEDs using two TLC5940 12bit LED drivers.

Programmer
----------

The ATmega is programmed using the standard ISP interface, however to save space,
a smaller footprint is used.
On standard PCBs with 1.6mm thickness, the board fits exacly between to RM 2.00 pins,
so I just use a 2x3 RM 2.00 pin header to attack my programmer to it from the side.
This takes up a *lot* less space and the connection is still relatively secure.


Parts List and Description
--------------------------

### Battery charger

Using [Sparkfuns USB Lipo charger](
https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10401)?


### Battery

This circuit can be powered by a standard 3.7V LiPo/LiIon rechargeable battery **without** voltage regulator.

### Microcontroller

A ATmega328P in a 32-pin TQFP package is used.

### Resonator

Small footprint, reasonable frequency stability of Â±0.5% at 8MHz:
[Reichelt part number CSTCE 8,00](
http://www.reichelt.de/index.html?ARTICLE=89701
).
Also comes in 10MHz, 12Mhz and 16Mhz.

Some background on the maximum possible frequency:
The 3.7V LiPo battery voltage can be anywhere between 3V to 4.2V.

The ATtiny44A is rated at 4Mhz @ 1.8V and 20Mhz @ 4.5V.
The relationship between maximum frequency and VCC is linear in the region
1.8V < VCC < 4.5V.

So, for 3V the maximum frequency is
(20 - 16)Mhz / (4.5 - 1.8)V * (3 - 1.8)V + 4Mhz = 11.1Mhz

So, we can use a 8Mhz resonator, without stability issues.

### Tactile Switch

A light touch switch from Panasonic is used: EVQPS with J-bend terminals:
EVQPSG02K without Boss


### Vibration sensor

MVS 0608.02 is used.
It's not widely available so you can leave it out.


### Other parts

Some 0603 and 0805 resistors and capacitors are used.

A RM 2.00 mm In-System Programming socket is used.
